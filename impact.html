        <h1>Current Impact</h1>
        <p>
          Although we are still a startup organization, our current impact is quite sizable. In our workshops
          in partnership with Branches of Hope, around 70 kids of asylum seekers have participated in our
          summer workshops. We lead sessions with the kids teaching them about different scientific concepts
          such as Newton's 3 Laws, acids and bases, chemical reactions, and gravity. Because of the
          enthusiastic participation, turnout, and enjoyment of the kids, Branches of Hope has featured our
          workshops on their social media. <br /><br />
          Moreover, with our workshops with Kei Fook Primary School we have also reached families around
          Cheung Sha Wan and Sham Shui Po who have experienced the brunt of the damage of COVID. To aid in
          their recovery process, our summer workshops have provided the kids a breath of fresh air with new
          experimental educational opportunities as well as provided them with free stationary in the forms of
          notebooks, pencils and erasers to encourage a continuation of their academic interest in the
          sciences.

        <h1>Potential Impact</h1>
        <p>
          Our potential impact will be much greater. We were alerted to the vast disparity and lack of
          educational resources many kids need in local schools around Hong Kong and especially to kids of
          asylum seekers who are forced to wait for years on an uncertain waitlist. Hence, we are currently in
          the stages of working on a free, interactive, and educational science website where students can
          access a library of science workshops produced by us and they can follow along at home with very
          simple materials. We believe that once this website has finished, we can reach a much larger crowd
          not only in Hong Kong but also in the wider Asia Pacific Region and across the world. This way, we
          can combat unequal access to STEM and help diversify the STEM industry.

        <p>
          Shortly after our founding, we reached out to Branches of Hope, an NGO dedicated to helping refugees
          and asylum seekers in Hong Kong, to coordinate summer workshops in the sciences. We received a
          tremendous amount of participation from Branches of Hope as around 70 kids of asylum seekers ranging
          from ages 4-12 participated in our summer courses which taught principles of gravity, Newtonâ€™s laws
          of motion, chemical reactions along with acids and bases through a hands-on process which involved
          students utilizing arts and crafts to construct a rocket over the period of a few sessions and on
          our last day, we launched all of them in a blaze of science! Overall, after our final session had
          concluded all of our students reported increased interest in the sciences and developed a lifelong
          interest in the STEM fields.

        <p>
          Kei Fook Primary School is a school located in the Cheung Sha Wan / Sham Shui Po region that
          provides education to many low income families in Hong Kong. We were fortunate to form a partnership
          with them and host in person science workshops on their campus with a class of curious and lively
          students. We conducted our rocket experiment once more and once again with great enthusiasm and
          reception from the students as well as teaching about the principles and oddities of non-newtonian
          fluids which was very eye opening for the children.
