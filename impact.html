        <h1>Current Impact:</h1>
        <p>
          Although we are still a startup organization, our current impact is
          quite sizable. In our workshops in partnership with Branches of Hope,
          around 70 kids of asylum seekers have participated in our summer
          workshops. We lead sessions with the kids teaching them about
          different scientific concepts such as Newton's 3 Laws, acids and
          bases, chemical reactions, and gravity. Because of the enthusiastic
          participation, turnout, and enjoyment of the kids, Branches of Hope
          has featured our workshops on their social media. <br /><br />
          Moreover, with our workshops with Kei Fook Primary School we have also
          reached families around Cheung Sha Wan and Sham Shui Po who have
          experienced the brunt of the damage of COVID. To aid in their recovery
          process, our summer workshops have provided the kids a breath of fresh
          air with new experimental educational opportunities as well as
          provided them with free stationary in the forms of notebooks, pencils
          and erasers to encourage a continuation of their academic interest in
          the sciences.

        <h1>Potential Impact:</h1>
        <p>
          Our potential impact will be much greater. We were alerted to the vast
          disparity and lack of educational resources many kids need in local
          schools around Hong Kong and especially to kids of asylum seekers who
          are forced to wait for years on an uncertain waitlist. Hence, we are
          currently in the stages of working on a free, interactive, and
          educational science website where students can access a library of
          science workshops produced by us and they can follow along at home
          with very simple materials. We believe that once this website has
          finished, we can reach a much larger crowd not only in Hong Kong but
          also in the wider Asia Pacific Region and across the world. This way,
          we can combat unequal access to STEM and help diversify the STEM
          industry.
