    <p style="font-family: Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: 28px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; line-height: 30px;">Hi. We are <b><span>Students For Science</span></b>, a student-led organization that have a massive passion for the sciences, computer science, and engineering. Our goal is to help underprivileged and refugees kids aged 4-12 in Hong Kong. We work with many organizations - Christian Action, Branches of Hope, RUN, Refugee Union - and different schools to help immerse students and kids into the sciences through our fun projects and science kits. 
<br><br>
Many schools that refugees go to don't have the sufficient equipment and teaching facilities to help develop students and let them learn fun science. We work with these schools to provide lessons and experiments for these kids to do. Seing that refugees are really underprivileged, as the government doesnt give them sufficient resources to survive, we really want to bring some joy and help these kids through a tough time in their lives. 
<br><br>
We also make and package science kits so that these kids can have fun and do fun and interactive experiments even while at home during the COVID pandemic. These experiements can also be carried out during the Tuesday CCA's and the Friday BOH Session.</p>
